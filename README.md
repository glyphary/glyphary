# Glyphary

+-----------------------------------------------------------+

Glyphary is a fully open-source, fast, responsive desktop Markdown workspace
for local vaults. It edits extended Markdown in true WYSIWYG mode, so tables,
columns, callouts, card links, image galleries, task lists, and expand/collapse
blocks are edited visually instead of through raw syntax.

</p>

## Get Started

A good first vault is the [Glyphary demonstration vault](https://github.com/glyphary/demo).
Download or clone it, then choose **File -> Open Vault...** in Glyphary and select
the demo folder. This lets you explore Glyphary before opening your own notes.
Until a vault is open, Glyphary keeps the window focused on that single task and
hides document-specific controls.

## Highlights

- **Visual extended Markdown editing**: edit rich Markdown structures directly, including tables with right-click row, column, and alignment actions; Mermaid diagrams; columns; callouts; rich card links; galleries; code blocks; task lists; and collapsible sections.
- **Obsidian compatibility where it matters**: open local vaults, resolve wikilinks and aliases, edit frontmatter as structured properties, render banner images, support compatible daily notes, load approved CSS snippets, and fully open/edit Obsidian `.canvas` files.
- **Vault library and favorites**: switch between remembered vaults with independent workspaces and optional covers, star any note, canvas, or Base, and drag starred files into your preferred order.
- **Fast local search**: built-in vault search is extremely fast and does not require an external `rg` install.
- **Command palette**: use quick commands for inserts, table actions, rich links, Excalidraw drawings, tidbits, canvas actions, and more.
- **Canvas support**: create, open, rename, edit, move, color, connect, and save Obsidian-compatible canvas nodes and edges.
- **Base views**: open `.base` files to browse vault notes through table or gallery views backed by local frontmatter.
- **Native desktop workflows**: use macOS menus and context menus, a separate Settings window, Finder/Open With integration, and file actions for opening, revealing, copying paths, creating, renaming, moving, or deleting.
- **Native Excalidraw integration**: create drawings from Glyphary and store them as vault files.
- **Daily notes and tidbits**: preview calendar notes on hover, open or create daily pages, create quick notes, and capture tidbits from anywhere when the app is running.
- **AI assistance**: connect an OpenAI-compatible backend for writing help, summaries, outlines, title generation, and page building.
- **Optional Vim mode**: use a practical Normal/Insert mode editing layer for keyboard-driven note work.
- **Focused reading and editing**: switch between View and Edit chrome, close every tab when you want a blank workspace, and configure `Cmd+T` to reopen a chosen vault note.
- **Themes and appearance**: choose light, dark, auto, glass, theme templates, CSS snippets, page banners, and editor treatments.
- **Plugin system**: enable vault-local plugins that run fast inside a WASM sandbox.

## Visual Editing

Glyphary keeps Markdown readable on disk while making the editing experience feel
like a native rich editor. This is especially useful for structures that are
awkward to maintain by hand, such as tables, columns, and callout-heavy notes.
Frontmatter uses the same direct approach: every property has a single-line row,
properties can be added, renamed, or removed, and tags or other multi-value
properties are edited as individual pills.

## Vaults And Navigation

The vault switcher remembers every folder you open and restores each vault's
own tabs, recent files, active page, drawers, and split layout. Vaults can have
custom cover images, and forgetting one removes it from the switcher without
touching its files.

The left drawer includes Files, Search, Recent, Starred, and Tasks. File rows
can show text and first-image previews, starred files can be reordered by
dragging, and rename or move operations keep open tabs, wikilinks, recent files,
and stars pointed at the new path. Documents open with one click by default; a
per-vault setting can require double-clicking instead. When the Files drawer is
active, the titlebar provides Back, New Note, and New Folder actions. Either
creation button can be hidden under the grouped Interface settings without
removing its context-menu command.

## Canvas

Glyphary opens Obsidian-compatible `.canvas` files as editable graph documents.
You can add cards, notes, media, web pages, groups, colors, and arrowed edges,
then save back to the original canvas file.

</p>

## Base Views

Glyphary can open `.base` files as local database-style views over your vault.
Definitions query Markdown frontmatter and render matching notes as tables or
gallery cards, including optional first-image thumbnails. Open views can be
searched by title, sorted by any available property, and trimmed to only the
properties you want to see.

## Search And Commands

Search, recent files, tasks, and quick commands are built into the workspace so
large vaults stay navigable. The command palette adapts to the current context:
Markdown notes get editing commands, tables get table commands, and canvases get
canvas commands. Open it with `Cmd+P` or the command button beside Save.

Content search groups matches by file, shows the match count for each result,
and sorts the list from the most recently modified page down to older notes.

On macOS, the native menu bar exposes File, Edit, Insert, Format, View, and
Window commands with current enabled and checked states. Native context menus
cover vault entries, tables, Base controls, and vault-library actions.

File and folder context menus include `Reveal in Finder`, so you can jump from a
vault entry to the native file manager without leaving the workspace.

When no document is open, Glyphary keeps the workspace calm: document-specific
commands wait until a note or canvas is open. Configure the New Tab file in
Settings to make `Cmd+T` open a favorite vault page such as a home note.

Remote YouTube URLs used as Markdown images render as video thumbnails in the
page; clicking the thumbnail opens the original video URL.

## AI

Glyphary supports AI through bring-your-own-key OpenAI-compatible backends. The
regular AI commands can improve writing, fix grammar, change tone, summarize,
expand, shorten, create outlines, generate titles, continue from the cursor, and
explain selected text.

The AI Builder is more ambitious: describe the page or section you want, and it
can generate rich Markdown content that uses Glyphary-native blocks. It can also
research the local vault with bounded retrieval, summarize a concept across
related notes, build tables of linked pages, and refine the same generated block
through follow-up prompts.

## Appearance

Glyphary supports light, dark, and auto modes, theme templates, approved CSS
snippets, a theme builder, basic Obsidian-style theme compatibility, optional
native glass, and a title-bar document proxy with Reveal, Open in Default App,
and Copy Path actions.

## Obsidian Sync

If you are paying for Obsidian Sync (I am!) and find that you are almost never opening Obsidian anymore
(I am so glad that Glyphary is working out for you!), you can still keep Obsidian sync going in the background:

```
npm install -g obsidian-headless
ob login
cd /path/to/vault
ob sync-setup --vault "<your vault name>"
ob sync --continuous
```

## Real-App Smoke Test

Run the desktop smoke test with `npm run e2e:tauri`. It uses `tauri-driver` to
launch the actual app against an owned scratch note in the current vault. Set
`GLYPHARY_E2E_VAULT=/path/to/vault` to choose the vault explicitly.

The reusable driver path is Windows/Linux only. On macOS, run the app manually
for now; Tauri does not expose a WebDriver bridge for the native webview there.
